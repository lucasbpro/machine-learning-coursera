# Exercise 1 - Linear Regression

This exercise explores the power of linear regression. It takes bi-dimensional data (x,y) and obtains a linear model which relates y to x.

## Linear Regression fundamentals

The linear regression for 2D data aims to obtain a linear model of the type y=ax+b which is closest as possible to the data points. In order to 
translate this to mathematical terms, we define a cost function which measures the distance from the straight line (linear model) to the data andthen run an optimization algorithm which finds the optimal parameters a and b such that, for the data we have, the cost function is minimized.

## Defining the cost function


## Implementing the Gradient Descent algorithm

e are unnumbered optimization algorithms avaialable, but Gradient Descent usually stands out thanks to its simplicity and low-computational cost.
