## Machine Learning - Coursera 

This repository contains my solutions to the assignments from the Machine-Learning course in Coursera, taught by Andrew Ng and offered by Stanford University.

## How to run the files

The assignments are split into the folders "ex1", "ex2" and so on, refering to different exercises. Most of the files within the folders are auxiliary functions called by a Matlab script. This script is usually the one which starts with "ex". 

So, for example, if you were see the solutions for Exercise 3, you should run the scripts "ex3.m" (multi-class logistic regression) and "ex3_nn.m" (multi-class classification by using Neural Networks) found at "ex3" folder.
