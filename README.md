## Machine Learning - Coursera 

This repository contains my solutions to the assignments from the Machine-Learning course in Coursera, taught by Andrew Ng and offered by Stanford University.

## How to run the files

The assignments are split into the folders "ex <number of the assignment>". Most of the files within the folders are auxiliary functions called by a main Matlab script that is usually the one which starts with "ex". 

So, for example, if you were to see the solutions for Exercise 3, you should run the scripts "ex3.m" (multi-class logistic regression) and "ex3_nn.m" (multi-class classification by using Neural Networks) found at "ex3" folder.
